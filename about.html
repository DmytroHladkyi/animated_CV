            <p>I am an international freight forwarder with 6 years of 
                experience. My strengths are high personal culture and an 
                attitude to achieve ambitious goals. I am a communicative 
                person and focused on professional development. I work in 
                German and English on a daily basis. I deal with planning, 
                ordering and billing of road transport, acquiring new transport 
                flows and negotiating with clients. I am a multi-tasker and 
                responsible person. I also received an official thank you for my 
                support in organizing transports from the manager at MAN 
                Niepołomice. I am looking for new professional challenges in 
                the IT industry. I am learning programming on my own through 
                various online sources. I try to refine projects found on the
                Internet and look for a solution on the Internet as well. I write 
                codes using Visual Studio Code and Python. I am attaching a 
                link to my profile on github:<span>https://github.com/DmytroHladkyi</span>. 
                I enjoy writing code because the code is well written and you 
                can see the end result. I really want to gain even more 
                experience and work with the best to be the best as well.
